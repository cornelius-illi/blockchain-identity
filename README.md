 * [Onename](https://onename.com/) Onename makes it easy to register and manage a blockchain ID. Users can create a personal or company profile and share their blockchain ID on their website, social media profiles and business cards so that others can easily find them online. Developers can integrate support for blockchain IDs to offer users password-less login, secure messaging and granular control over data access and privacy. With a blockchain ID, users are in control of their online identity. Developed by [Blockstack](https://github.com/blockstack).
 * A workshop called [“Rebooting the Web-of-Trust”](http://weboftrust.info/) has produced a paper about a [Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/raw/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf) (DPKI), which registers identifiers and associated public keys on blockchains.

 * [Shocard](https://shocard.com/) is an early stage company developing an “identity platform” built on blockchain. A user’s identity is encrypted, hashed and then written to the blockchain, where it can be called up when needed. Users would, in effect, give banks temporary access to the private side of this blockchain record in order to verify identity. Once that is done, the bank creates its own record that can be consulted in the future to determine that a certain Joe Smith is really Joe Smith.

It embraces subjectivity over consensus, e.g. each identity can publish messages that map their favorite pet name mappings for themselves and others. [Patchwork](https://ssbc.github.io/patchwork/) is a user-facing decentralized messaging and sharing app based on Scuttlebot.
 * Startup Cambridge Blockchain is working on an [Identity Blockchain](http://cambridge-blockchain.com/alpha_genesis_block.html) for validating secure digital identity documents, processing electronic signatures, and recording transactions.
 * [Proof-of-Individuality](http://proofofindividuality.online/) addresses the challenge to prove that a person only has one account within a system, without sacrificing the advantages of anonymity/pseudonymity. See [here](https://medium.com/@unlisted/anti-sybil-protocol-using-virtual-pseudonym-parties-10276fcf3b20) for a draft implementation using "virtual pseudonym parties".
 * [Regis](http://regis.nu/) is a platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage decentralized registries on the Ethereum blockchain.

Whether it’s a biometric bitcoin wallet or a smart-contract platform, HYPR augments security by decentralizing the storage of private keys.
 * [BlockAuth](http://blockauth.org/): BlockAuth enables you to own and operate your own identity registrar that allows users to submit their information for verification.
 * [Case](https://choosecase.com/): Provides biometrically secured multisignature bitcoin transactions. Case is a multisignature, multifactor wallet that requires two of three keys for a transaction to take place. Each key is generated and stored in a different location and is protected by a different authentication factor so that there’s no single point of failure.
 * [Airbitz](https://airbitz.co/bitcoin-wallet/) A bitboin wallet/ identity solution
 * [Mooti](http://mootipass.com/) is the new standard for cryptographic identification and validation. based on our identity chain technology, we are reimagining the security of personally identifiable information and authentication.
